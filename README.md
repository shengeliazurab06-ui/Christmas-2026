This is a multi-page website for Santa's Workshop. It has everything you need for the holidays: a gift list, music, and festive animations.

## ✨ What's Inside?
- **Home Page:** A warm welcome to the North Pole.

- **Naughty or Nice Checker:** See if you have been good this year.
- **Toy Inventory:** Browse the full list of toys made by elves.

## 🛠️ How I Built It
- **HTML & CSS:** For the website structure and festive design.
- **JavaScript:** For the gift list logic, music, and snow effects.
- **Special Effects:** Confetti animations and 3D elements.

## 🚀 How to Open the Site
To see the website, make sure all project files are in the same folder. 

Open the **`index.html`** file in any web browser. This is the main file that starts the website and  connected with the design (CSS) and the logic (JavaScript).
